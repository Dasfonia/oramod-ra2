##Roadmap:

1) Stay true to vanilla RA2 (for now)

2) Implement factions in order

3) Implement actor types in order for each faction

Factions:
* America
* Korea
* France
* Germany
* Great Britain
* Libya
* Cuba
* Iraq
* Russia

Actors:
* Structures (power plant â†’ tech center)
* Support structures (walls, defenses, etc)
* Vehicles
* Infantry
* Aircraft
* Naval
* Special Units (including infiltration unlocks)

For example:
All American structures should be done first.
Many of these are generic Allied structures which is fine.
By `done` I mean proper art (offsets and frames) and complete rules (as much as the engine allows).

After all actors are in the game we can focus on support powers / superweapons.
